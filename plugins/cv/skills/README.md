## cv-analyst

General-purpose CV retrieval and summarization. Outputs: markdown, plain text, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, Typst.

- HTML, LaTeX, and Typst are server-rendered via `get_cv(format=...)` — no client-side template assembly
- Summarization (depth, audience, tone, emphasis) applies to markdown/plain text only
- Delegates to cv-tailoring when a job description is introduced

## cv-tailoring

- Integrates with LinkedIn MCP server for job description retrieval
- 7-step workflow: obtain job context, retrieve CV, analyze, generate spec, render, integrity check, deliver
- Produces 6 deliverables: intelligence brief, repositioned CV, spec, compiled PDF, alignment assessment, positioning summary
